  Let's go ahead.
  Fedora installation is running on the new machine,
  but we need a lot of dotfiles yet.
  
  **bash**  
  Here we got with the bash.
  let's try to find a good portable arch, with aliases, and usefull stuff.
  We also need the incremental bash completion tool. Essential.
  ```
    .bashrc
    .bash_aliases
  ```

  **wm**  
  The Window Manager could be Sway, for Wayland or i3 for X.
  Have a look also at the default term.
  ```
    .config/wm/config
    .config/wm/backlight
    .config/wmbar/config
    .config/wmbar/style.css
  ```

  **git**  
  Maybe only one file needed. (Maybe)
  ```
    .gitconfig
  ```
